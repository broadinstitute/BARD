<h1>Parity</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Parity is a general type of specification of chirality. 
The two most commonly used types, Tetrahedral Parity and Allene-like Parity, is implemented.
 
<h2>Tetrahedral Parity</h2>


<h3>Global Parity</h3>
 A parity value 0 is used for atoms, which cannot have parity.
 An atom has nonzero global parity, if the following conditions are met:
 <ul>
     <li> Tetrahedral central atom has parity, if</li>
     <ul>
         <li> 4 different types of ligands around the central atom, </li>
         <li> implicit hydrogens and lone pairs also considered as ligands,</li>
         <li> implicit and explicit hydrogen does not count as different kinds of ligands.</li>
     </ul> 
     <li> Tetrahedral central atom <i> in a ring </i> has parity, if </li>
     <ul>
         <li> the central atom has 2 different kinds of ligands outside the ring, </li>
         <li> if the graph invariant of the ring is <i>not</i> the same in the
              two sides of the central atom, </li>
         <li> if the graph invariant of the ring <i>is the same </i> in the 
              two sides of the central atom, but</li>
         <ul>
            <li> the ring contains even numbers of atoms (including the parity central atom),</li>
            <li> there is an atom with nonzero parity in the opposite side of the ring: <br>

               <IMG SRC="p002.png" ALT="parity in rings">   </li>
         </ul>
     </ul> 
     <li> Atoms N, P and S in ring have parity, if</li>
     <ul>
          <li> they are bridge atoms. <br>
             <IMG SRC="p005.png" ALT="bridge atoms">
          </li>
             
     </ul>
     <li> N has parity in a 3 membered ring,</li>
     <ul>
          <li> if the graph invariant of the ring is <i>not</i> the same in the 
               two sides of the nitrogen atom.
     </ul> 
 </ul>
 The value of global parity is determined as follows <a HREF="#ref1">[1]</a>. 
 <ul>
   <li>Number the atoms around the stereocenter according to 
      the position in the atom block. </li>
   <li>Hydrogen gets the highest value, in this case 4.</li>
   <li>View the molecule such, that the atom that has the highest number is behind the
      plane formed by the other three atoms.</li>
   <li>Now, the three atoms forming the plane may arrange </li>
   <ul>
     <li> either clockwise, in which case the general parity of the stereo center 
         is called <i>ODD</i>,</li>
     <li> or counterclockwise, in which case the general parity of the stereo center
        is called <i>EVEN</i>.</li>
   </ul>
 </ul>
 
<h3>Local Parity</h3>
  An atom have nonzero local parity, if
  <ul>
     <li> number of implicit and explicit H &lt; 3, </li>
     <li> number of implicit H &lt; 2. </li>
  </ul> 
  The determination of he local parity is similar to that of global parity: 
  <ul>
     <li>Number the atoms around the stereocenter according to 
         the atom number (position in the atom block). </li>
     <li>Hydrogens get the highest values: 
         a constant number is added to the atom number of all the H atoms.  </li>
     <li>View the molecule such, that the atom that has the highest number is behind the
         plane formed by the other three atoms.</li>
     <li>Now, the three atoms forming the plane may arrange </li>
     <ul>
       <li> either clockwise, in which case the local parity of the stereo center 
            is called <i>ODD</i>,</li>
       <li> or counterclockwise, in which case the local parity of the stereo center
            is called <i>EVEN</i>.</li>
     </ul>
 </ul>
 For example, the molecule depicted below has nonzero local 
 but zero global parity value: <br>

<h2>Allene-like Parity</h2>
  An atom can have allene-like parity if the following condition holds: 
  <ul>
    <li>there are equal numbers of double bonds in each side of the central atom,</li>
    <li>there are at least two different ligands on both terminal atoms. </li>
  </ul> 
  In connection with allene-like parity <i>local</i> and <i> global </i> types are not
  differentiated. <br>
  Allene like parity is defined as follows.
  <ul>
     <li>Number the two pairs of atoms which connect to the central atom
         through one single and odd number of double bond with 
         1, 2, 3 and 4 in order of increasing atom number 
         (position in the atom block). </li>
     <li>Hydrogen atom should be the highest numbered atom, in this
         case atom 4. </li> 
     <li>If the molecule contains two hydrogen atoms,
         then that one gets the smaller value (3), 
         which is on the same side of the central atom as
         the ligand with higher atom number. </li>
     <li>View the molecule such, that the atom that has the highest number 
         is behind the plane formed by the other three atoms.</li>
     <li>Now, the three atoms forming the plane may arrange  </li>
     <ul>
       <li> either clockwise, in which case the parity of the stereo center 
            has the value 1, </li>
       <li> or counterclockwise, in which case the parity of the stereo center
            has the value 2. </li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
