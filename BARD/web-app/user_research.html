<h1>Information on the BioAssay Research Database (BARD) Usability Research</h1>
<h2>Usability Study Objectives</h2>
<p>As we design BARD we wish to talk with our key end users: Biologists, Chemists, and Bio-informatics professionals
    involved in BioAssay research. Our goal is to ensure BARD's design is self-explanatory and that this database meets
    the needs of scientific researchers working in early stage drug discovery.</p>
<p>The results from our studies will be used to:
    <ul>
        <li>guide the organization of BARD's features and data</li>
        <li>optimize searching and analysis of BARD data</li>
        <li>optimize the overall user experience of using BARD so it becomes an often visited and indispensable resource for researchers in early stage drug discovery</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Participants</h2>
<p>We seek seasoned Biologists, Chemists, and Bio- & Cheminformatics professionals who are:
    <ul>
        <li>Passionate about their work, demonstrated commitment to their profession and to altruistic goals of advancing human health through drug discovery</li>
        <li>Familiar with PubChem and/or other similar public databases (ChEMBL, ChemBank, etc.)</li>
        <li>Work in early stage drug discovery as researchers and team leaders</li>
        <li>Work in a variety of organizational environments: MLPCN centers, private pharmaceutical companies, and academic & non-profit research facilities</li>
    </ul>
All information we collect is kept confidential and anonymous. We may record the sessions with the participant's permission.
</p>
<h2>Study Activities</h2>
<p>We are planning on running several types of studies throughout the course of this development project. These include
    user interviews, usability studies, site visits, and online surveys. Our studies will be carried out both
    face-to-face as well as over the phone and via Web conference.  If you are interested in participating, please
    contact <a href="mailto:bard-ux-study@broadinstitute.org">Jacqui Conforti</a>.
