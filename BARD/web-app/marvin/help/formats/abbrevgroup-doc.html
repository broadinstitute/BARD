<h1>ChemAxon SMILES Abbreviated Groups</h1>

<p>
Codename: <strong>abbrevgroup</strong>

<h3>File format for abbreviated groups in Marvin</h3>
<p>
    Abbreviated groups are stored in a TAB-delimited text file called
    <b>default.abbrevgroup</b>.
    The basic format is:
</p>
<pre>
    Ac	CC=O	2
    AcAc	CC(=O)CC(=O)	5
    Acet	CC=O	2
    Ade	NC1=C2N=CNC2=NC=N1	6	1
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Please make sure the words are separated by TAB characters not by
	spaces.</b>
</p>
<p>
    In these lines the very first word is the abbreviation, the second is the
    SMILES string representing the molecule fragment depicted by the
    abbreviation. These are followed by one or two numbers that are the
    number(s) of link nodes (atoms) in the SMILES string. In the first
    line using the <b>Ac</b> abbreviation the second carbon is the
    link when the group is connected to an other molecule. If there is no number
    following the the SMILES string the abbreviated group can not be linked to
    other atoms. Furtheremore the maximal number of link nodes are two.
</p>
<p>
    Usually the bond points towards the middle of the abbreviation but when
    the string contains atom symbols, probably we want to make it point
    to the symbol of the bonding atom. Furthermore it is desirable to flip the
    abbreviation when the group is in the opposite side:
</p>
<img src="abbrev_1.png" alt="Flipped abbreviated groups CN and COOH">
<p>
    To achieve the flipping effect one have to provide the alternative name
    of the abbreviated group that will be printed on the left side of the
    molecule:</p>
    <pre>
	CN	C#N	1	leftName=NC
	CO2Et	CCOC=O	4	leftName=EtO2C
	CO2H	OC=O	2	leftName=HO2C
	COOH	OC=O	2	leftName=HOOC
	COOiAm	CC(C)CCOC=O	7	leftName=iAmOOC
    </pre>
    <p>
    If the abbreviation contains numbers, those will be treated as subscripts:</p>
    <pre>
	C10H21	CCCCCCCCCC	1	leftName=H21C10
	CBr3	BrC(Br)Br	2	leftName=Br3C
    </pre>
    <img src="abbrev_2.png" alt="Numbers as subscripts in abbreviated names">

<p>
    Additionally there can be groups where it is good to have flipping
    abbreviations but the string represents the form that is used on the left
    side. For these groups (for example AcO, MeO) the <b>rightName</b> specifier
    can be used:</p>
    <pre>
	BnNH	NCC1=CC=CC=C1	1	rightName=HNBn
	BnO	OCC1=CC=CC=C1	1	rightName=OBn
	BnO2C	O=COCC1=CC=CC=C1	2	rightName=CO2Bn
	BnOOC	O=COCC1=CC=CC=C1	2	rightName=COOBn
    </pre>
    <img src="abbrev_3.png" alt="Abbreviations on the right.">
    <p>
    If you do not want to flip an abbreviation but want to be sure that the
    bond points to an atom symbol and not to the middle of the string, you
    still can define the <b>center</b> specifier:</p>
    <pre>
	c-C10H19	C1CCCCCCCCC1	1	center=AUTO
	c-C11H21	C1CCCCCCCCCC1	1	center=AUTO
	c-C12H23	C1CCCCCCCCCCC1	1	center=AUTO
    </pre>
    <img src="abbrev_4.png" alt="Bonds pointing to an atom">
    <p>
    This option allows to point to the very first character in the abbreviated
    group string that is the same as the atom symbol of the binding atom. This
    option makes it possible to fine-tune the position of the bond to point to
    any of the characters.
    </p>

<h3>Extending the built-in abbreviated groups</h3>
	<p>
	From the 5.10 release extension possibilities have been introduced for the default
	built-in abbreviated groups.</p>
	<p>
	A user can define abbreviated groups to be used in MarvinSketch in a file called
	user.abbrevgroup. This file has to be placed in the chemaxon settings directory
	that is located in the chemaxon or .chemaxon folder inside the home directory of
	the user.
	</p>
	<p>
	For developers who are developing based on the MarvinBeans library, or who are using
	the Marvin Applets package, it is possible to extend the abbreviated group list via 
	files that can be defined for usage in MarvinSketch with the help of the <A 
	href="../developer/sketchman.html#parameters.customAbbrevgroups">customAbbrevgroups</a>
	parameter.<br/>
	</p>
