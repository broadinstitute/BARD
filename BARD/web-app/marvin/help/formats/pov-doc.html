<title>POV-Ray export in Marvin</title>

<h1>POV-Ray</h1>

<p>
Codename: <strong>pov</strong>

<p>
Marvin is capable of creating a blob object from the molecule that can be
included in input files for the
Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer.
However, as MarvinSketch is still primarily a 2D sketcher, the POV-Ray
output is not as nice as it could be.
<p>
POV-Ray export is an experimental feature that might be improved in the future
as Marvin gets more 3D capabilities.
