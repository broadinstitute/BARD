- preferences/checkers list and Add checker window list not the same (alphabetical order)
- into docs: moving checkers up/down
- hide fixers that can not modify the molecule (pl. sajtgyár alias cant be fixed by converting to abbrev gr.)
- unit test for all checkers/fixers, should contain multiple cases, current unit test too few, too simple, partly not working for the checker 

******************************************************

# abbre gr: 
  -- 2 options are needed (check boxes): contracted/expanded

# alias: DEFAULT
  -- present fix option Remove alias to be renamed Delete alias atom, 
  -- add 3rd fix option: Remove alias without deleting atom
  -- alias checker detects pseudo as alias (bug)
  -- Remove alias fixer deleted an abbrev. gr that was converted from an alias 
  -- checker options: check atom symbol; check abbreviaton; check unknown alias (like brokkoli) 
  
	*test actions (alias.mrv): inserted 2 alias, 1 pseudo. 1 alias converted to abberv group (Ph). Checker found 1 abbr gr and 2 alias. Alias Checker detects pseudo as alias.
 Alias fixer removes the real alias atoms (although 1 converted to abbr gr), but pseudo is not removed.

# Pseudo Atom Checker should be implemented.  DEFAULT
  -- checker options: check atom symbol; check abbreviaton; check unknown pseudo (like brokkoli)
  -- fix options: delete pseudo atom; convert to carbon; convert to atom; convert to abbrev. group

# aromaticity: 
  -- in case of multiple incorrect ring structures in a canvas, one or more fragments are not considered, only one -> not all incorrect aromatics are detected (aromaticity.mrv/1)
  -- changing arom. checker option in Pref dialog throws exception
  -- basic aromat. does not detect pyridone mol. problem (it should mark it as an error) (mols from file: 2 or 3)
  -- experienced behaviour: loose option does not work, result same as in csae of general (aromaticity.mrv/4)

# atom map
  OK; incompatibility with missing  atom map checker

# atom value
  -- not working

# attach data
  -- fix options text is wrong: rename Remove affected atom to Delete atom

# bond angle  DEF
  -- not working, implement chain angles (bondangle.mrv)
  -- implement internal angles of rings (5.3 if sufficient time)
  -- should not run in 3D

# bond length   DEF
  -- bug: call PartialClean only for that bond (presently all the canvas is cleaned!!!)  (tested on bondangle.mrv)
  -- should not run in 3D

# crossed-double bond
  -- narrow end of wiggly should be connected to the (ex-crossed) double bond. crossed_wiggly.mrv/1 example molecule should not be detected as wiggly double (because it is a chiral atom just next to a double bond). 2nd example is NOT a wiggly double neither..
  -- see standardizer 
  
# explicit H   DEF
  -- by default all checker options are checked
  -- checker is working (explicitH.mrv), only for regular explH (no radical, no isotope), option setting (Pref dialog) has no effect.
  -- fix selected: extra wedge was added to OH

# invalid chiral flag   DEF
   -- rename Remove absolute stereo data to Fix chiral flag
   -- fix chiral flag fixer should set the chiral flag in case of molecules having stereo center(s), remove chiral flag in case of mols not having stereo centers (see standardizer)
   -- not working, always displays an error (see chiralflagchecker.mrv)

# implement Chiral flag checker with Remove chiral flag fixer

#invalid reaction map   
  -- not working


# invalid stereo   DEF
  -- not working (invalidstereo.mrv)
  -- rename to Invalid stereo wedge checker

# isotope
  -- OK

# missing atom map
  OK; incompatibility with atom map checker
  -- should work if no map is found at all

# molecule charge 
  -- fixer removes the charge sign, but impl. Hs are not recalculated
  -- in reaction, charge is not detected (on purpose?)
  -- NH4+ ->fix leaves NH4 instead of NH3. Probably should be fixed in marvin.

# multicenter
  -- not working (multicenter.mrv)


# implement coordinate bond checker NEW!

# overlapping atoms   DEF
  OK

# overlapping bonds
   OK but should have a smaller distance limit than in case of overlapping atom radius

# query atoms
  -- Group atom (Gx) should be detected as query atom

# query bonds
  OK

# radical 
  -- bug as with charge: remove the dots but nude atom makes no sense. Impl. Hs are not recalculated

# 3D
  -- rename Clean molecule to Convert molecule to 2D
  -- bond angle checker should not run in 3D

# valence  DEF
  OK

# wiggly double
  -- narrow end of wiggly should be connected to the (ex-crossed) double bond. crossed_wiggly.mrv/1 example molecule should not be detected as wiggly double (because it is a chiral atom just next to a double bond). 2nd example is NOT a wiggly double neither..
