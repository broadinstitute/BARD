/*
 This is a fix to a bug in twitter bootstrap in the dl-horizontal class.
 A non-breaking space after each dd element in a dl.dl-horiztonal css will fix the issue 
 and it prevents the dd elements from encroaching upon one another if they have no content.
 Fix reference: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2824
 Note: This bug might have been fix in a different way in a most recent version of bootstrap
