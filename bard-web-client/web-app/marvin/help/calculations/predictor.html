    <h1>Predictor plugin</h1>
<p>Predictor can be applied for molecular property prediction based on structure. Experimental data sets are analyzed and a calculation method applied in cases where molecular properties can be expressed as the sum of atomic contributions. The method is based on QSAR algorithm using a multiple linear regression model and a least squares fitting.
<p>The training of the calculator with your experimental data of your chemical compounds will create a trainig set file saved to your home directory, 
that can be used by Marvin's predictor plugin. A dropdown list will contain all the training 
sets you have created. For the training of the plugin, <a href="predictor_training.html">see this page</a>.


<p>In the <b CLASS="buttonName">Predictor</b> panel you can choose the training you want to make 
the prediction with:

	<tr>

		<td>The options are inactive and a short help text appears if you have not created any training sets.
	</tr>
	<tr>	<td><img src="images/predictor_active_panel.png" width="257" height="118"></td>
		<td>The options are active. you can choose the training set to apply from the dropdown list.
	</tr>

<p><b>Options</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Decimal places:</b> setting the number of decimal places with which the result value is given.</p></li>
<li><b>Training:</b> The dropdown list contains all training sets you created before.
