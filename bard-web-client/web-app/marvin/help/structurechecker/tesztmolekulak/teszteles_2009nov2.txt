General issue: after fix, Undo is ok, Redo does not work.


# alias: 
  alias convert to atom: carbon atom with F alias resulted in fluorine decorated with impl. hydrogens: -FH3, -FH2- (This is the same as impl. Hs of carbon.)

# aromaticity
  known issue: missing atom map removed from checker list, still warns. (Csepi working on it)
  -- checker checks for aromatized molecule, fix options: rearomatize by basic method / rearomatize by general method / rearomatize by loose method; dearomatize. Method selection: corresponding to checker option. Dearomatize option in all cases.


# pseudo: removePseudoFixer superfluous, RemoveAtomFixer should do the trick

# atom map, missing atom map
   OK

# atom value 
  OK

# attached data
   OK

# bond length 
   OK, partial clean to be implemented later

# bond angle
   OK,  to be implemented later than 5.3, leave out from release 5.3


# explicit H
  OK

#invalid chiral flag
  fixer description renamed by us. Test file in the zip: invalidchiralflag.mrv

# implement Chiral flag checker with Remove chiral flag fixer : specification & implementation after 5.3 release

# invalid reaction map 
   action order: first unmap existing, then map the whole reaction
    to be implemented later: mapping options: map complete / map changing / map matching; unmap 

# invalid stereo 
  as it is a double bond issue, it should be named Invalid Double Bond stereo

# molecule charge 
  OK

# multicenter
  to be renamed to Invalid coordinate system checker in the GUI as well

#overlapping bond 
  distance limit: 2/3 of atom radius

# Query atom checker: A, Q detected as query atom, other 6 (generic query atom) not. They are written in italics. Maybe internally represented as  pseudo? Marvin core bug?
 -- Group atom (Gx) should be detected as query atom: contact with MolAtom's developers, after 5.3 release

# 3D
  -- rename Clean molecule to Convert molecule to 2D

# radical
  OK

# wiggly double bond
   fixer is missing! str. checker gives unnamed as option, but fixes the issue correctly
