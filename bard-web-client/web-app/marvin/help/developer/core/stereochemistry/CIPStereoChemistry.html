 <h2>Introduction (new HTML, for chemical background see UGM doc)</h2>
 Molecules with same connectivity but different spatial arrangement are called stereoisomers. This section is about representation of the stereodescriptors.
Stereoisomer types:
<ul>
<li>Enantiomers: Molecules that are non-superimposable, complete mirror images of each other.<br>
<img src="enantiomers.png"/>
<li>Diastereomers: Stereoisomers that are not enantiomers.<br>
<img src="diastereomers.png"/>
</ul> -->

 <h2>Definitions</h2>
 <h3>Tetrahedral stereo descriptor</h3>
<p>Parity is a simplified and local description of a chiral center. 
It is used for string the three dimensional arrangement of the ligands around a chiral center 
in a local canonical way without using the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn-Ingold-Prelog_priority_rules">
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules</a>. 
The ligands of the chiral center are numbered according to the atom indexes in the molecule.
If the atom has implicit Hydrogen, then this implicit Hydrogen atom is considered to be
the highest numbered atom. The tetrahedral center atom is viewed such a way that the highest-numbered atom
is behind the plane formed by the other three atoms. The three atoms can be
arranged in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction in ascending numerical order.</p>

</table><br>
<p>Parity value <code>TetrahedralStereoValue.ODD</code> is assigned for a 
clockwise arrangement at the stereo center and
<code>TetrahedralStereoValue.EVEN</code> for
counterclockwise. If the center has wiggly (wavy) bond then 
<code>TetrahedralStereoValue.WIGGLY</code> value is assigned, 
otherwise if 
the given information is not enough to decide the spatial arrangement (e.g. no wedges in two dimensions) 
<code>TetrahedralStereoValue.UNKNOWN</code> value is assigned.</p>

<h3>Atrop stereo descriptor</h3>
  <p>Hindered rotation around single bonds where the steric strain barrier to 
  rotation is high enough to allow the isolation of the conformers resulting in
  atrop stereoisomerism.<br>
  Atrop stereo descriptor represents the topology of the case when two aromatic
  rings connected by a single bond with at least three ortho ligands.</p>
  <img src="simpleAtrop.png"/>
  <p>We look at the molecule in the direction of the single bond between the two aromatic rings (axis). 
  On the example shown below the red arrow indicates the direction of the view.</p>
  <br> <img src="atropEvenWithColors.png"/><br>
  <p>The axis is looked at from the direction where the highest indexed ligand connected to the axis (atom index 12) is behind the axis. 
  The angle between two bonds connecting the highest indexed ligands on both sides to the axis is 
  considered. On the example these are the bond between atoms 5 (marked blue) and 6 (in front of the axis) 
  and the bond between atoms 12 (marked green) and 7. <br>
 <!-- @@picture --> 
  <ul>
   <li><code>AtropStereoValue.EVEN</code> means that the angle is positive (between 0 and Pi).</li>
   <li><code>AtropStereoValue.ODD</code> means that the angle is negative (between 0 and -Pi).</li>
   <li><code>AtropStereoValue.UNKNOWN</code> means that the angle is near 0 or Pi (5&deg; threshold), or not defined
   (2d structure without wedge information). </li>
   <li><code>AtropStereoValue.WIGGLY</code> means that either the axis, or any of the bonds in the rings connected
   to the axis is WIGGLY.</li>
  </ul>
 <h3><a name="axial"> </a>Axial stereo descriptor</h3>
  <p>If two stereoactive atoms (atoms with at least three different ligands) are connected by an even numbered 
  <a href="#chain of rigid parts">chain of rigid parts</a> then axial
  stereo information can be defined on the ligands of the stereactive atoms. These ligands are the ones which are not in the chain of the rigid part.</p>
  <img src="simpleAxial.png"/>
  <p>Here we consider the chain of rigid parts as an axis. 
   Number the ligands at the end of the chain according to their atom indices. 
   Implicit hydrogen is got the lowest number, -1.
   The axis is looked at from the direction where the highest indexed ligand connected 
   to the axis is behind the axis. On the example below the axis is formed by the bonds between atoms 
   with indexes 1 and 3. The red arrow indicates the direction of view.</p> 
   <table>
     <tr>
       <td>
         <img src="axialEvenWithColors.png"/>

         <img src="axialEvenFromAxis.png"/><br>
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>   
   The angle between two bonds connecting the highest indexed ligands on both sides of the axis is 
   considered. On the example these are the bond between atoms 5 (marked blue) and 1 (in front of the axis) 
   and the bond between atoms 6 (marked green) and 3. 
   <ul>
     <li><code>AxialStereoValue.EVEN</code> means that the angle is positive (between 0 and Pi).</li>  
     <li><code>AxialStereoValue.ODD</code> means that the angle is negative (0 and -Pi).</li>
     <li><code>AxialStereoValue.UNKNOWN</code> means that the angle is near 0 or Pi (5&deg; threshold), or not defined
               (2d structure without wedge information). </li>
     <li><code>AxialStereoValue.WIGGLY</code> means that any of the non-rigid-part-bonds connected to any of
               the stereoactive atoms is WIGGLY.</li>
  </ul>

 <h3><a name="cistrans">CIS/TRANS stereo descriptor</h3>
<p>In general, single bonds are rotatable, but double bonds are not. If the substituents on each side of the
double bond are different then two diastereomers of the molecule can be distinguished based on the
orientation of the ligands. Two substituents located on the same side of the reference plane defined by the double bond are referred to
as cis isomer, otherwise, if the two substituents are located on the opposite side of the reference plane then 
it is referred to as trans isomer.</p>

      <td colspan="2" align="center"><code> CisTransStereoValue.CIS</code></td>
	</tr>

<br>
<p>
Alicyclic compounds can also display cis-trans isomerism. In this case the so called rigid part becomes non-
rotatable due to the constrain of a cycle.

 <h2><a name="rigid parts"></a>Rigid Parts</h2>
Stereo active atoms are considered at the ends of rigid parts or chains of rigid parts. 
The following substructures are considered as rigid parts:
 <ul>
 <li> Double bonds. </li>
 <li> Four or six membered rings. <br>
   <img src="rings.png"/> </li>
 <li> Four-four and six-six membered fused ring pairs.  <br>
   <img src="ringPairs.png"/> </li>
 <li> Odd membered rings having lower than eight members, connected to each other 
      directly or connected by intermediate four or six membered rings. Connection of two rings
      means that they share exactly one common bond (all rings are fused). The 
      intermediate even membered rings have to connect to other rings by bonds on the opposite sides.</li><br> 
   <img src="ringChains.png"/> <br>
   The following chain of rings is not a rigid part because the second intermediate
   ring connects to its neighbors not by opposite bonds (marked green):<br>   
   <img src="notRingChain.png"/> </li>
 </ul>
 <p>The rigid part is represented by the atoms and bonds of the outer hull. The outer
 hull is detected as the symmetrical difference of all ring bonds contained
 in the system. The hull of a rigid part is marked green on the following example.
 There is always an opposite atom for each contained atom in a rigid part, e.g.
 atom 13 is the opposite of atom 17 on the example. </p> 
   <img src="hull.png"/>

 <p>The same ring can be contained in more than one rigid system (e.g. all
 six-six membered ring pairs are detected as two separate six membered 
 rings as well). 
 On the example below the red ring and the blue ring are detected 
 as rigid parts (their common bond is purple) as well as the union of the two 
 fused rings (marked with thicker bonds).</p>
   <img src="multiRecognition.png"/>

 <h3><a name="not supported rigid parts"></a>Not supported rigid parts</h3>
 The more complex cases listed below are also rigid ring systems which are not 
 supported yet, these will be handled in future releases:
 <ul>
 <li> Condensed ring systems consisting of more than two fused rings.<br>
   <img src="condensedRings.png"/> </li>
 <li> Molecules where ring chains are fused (where at least 
 three rings share the same common bond and this is their only interesection).
 In this case it is possible that not all chains will be found.
 The common bond between atoms 4 and 10 shared by chains of rings between the 
 three odd membered rings at the ends is marked red on the example below.<br>
   <img src="chains3D.png"/> </li>
 </ul>   
 
 
<h3><a name="chain of rigid parts"></a>Chain of Rigid Parts</h3>
 Stereo active atoms can be connected to each other by a chain of <a href="#rigid parts">rigid parts</a> where
 the rigid parts are connected to another by exactly one atom (which is a 
 spiro join for rings) and these connections are on opposite atoms of the rigid parts.
 On the example below each rigid part defining the chain of rigid parts between atoms
 12 and 33 is marked with different color.<br>
   <img src="rigidChain.png"/><br>
 The type of the stereo active descriptor depends on the number of rigid parts in the
 chain of rigid parts: it is <a href="#axial">axial</a> if the number is even, 
 <a href="#cistrans">cis/trans</a> if the number is odd. On the above example the 
 number of rigid parts between atoms 12 and 33 is seven thus their ligands with indexes
 35 and 36 are in trans position. 

<h2>Stereo Active Part (SAP)</h2>
 <p>Stereo active part of a molecule is an atom with 0 to 4 ligands that can have tetrahedral stereo information,
 or with another stereo active part CIS/TRANS, ATROP or AXIAL stereo information.</p>
 <p>Stereo centers with more than 4 connections are not supported yet.</p>
 
 
 <h2>CIPStereoDescriptor types</h2>
	<h3>TetrahedralStereoDescriptor</h3>
	The stereo active center and its ligands are defined in one
	SAP. The TetrahedralStereoValue defines the spatial
	arrangement of the ligands around the stereocenter (UNKNOWN, ODD, EVEN,
	WIGGLY).

	<h3>AtropStereoDescriptor</h3>
	The stereo active single bond (with hindered rotation) which connects two aromatic rings 
	is represented with two SAPs. 
	Each StereoActivePart contains a stereo active atom which is the endpoint of the single bond 
	and the ligands which are connected by aromatic bond to this active atom.
	(Such a way the stereo active single bond ligand is not part of the ligands array.)
	The AtropStereoValue defines the spatial
	arrangement of the ligands around the stereo active single bond 
	(UNKNOWN, ODD, EVEN, WIGGLY)
	
	<h3>AxialStereoDescriptor</h3>
	The two stereo active atoms (atoms with at least three different ligands) 
	which are connected by even number of 
	<a href="#rigid parts">rigid parts</a> are represented 
	with two SAPs. Each StereoActivePart contains the 
	stereo active atom and the ligands of the stereactive atoms. These ligands are the ones which are not in the chain of the rigid part..
  	The AxialStereoValue defines the spatial
	arrangement of the ligands around the two stereo active atoms 
	(UNKNOWN, ODD, EVEN, WIGGLY)
	
	<h3>CisTransStereoDescriptor</h3>
	The two stereo active atoms (atoms with at least three different ligands) 
	which are connected by odd number of 
	<a href="#rigid parts">rigid parts</a> are represented 
	with two SAPs. Each StereoActivePart contains the 
	stereo active atom and the ligands of the stereactive atoms. These ligands are the ones which are not in the chain of the rigid part..
  	The CisTransStereoValue defines the spatial
	arrangement of the ligands around the two stereo active atoms 
	(UNKNOWN, CIS, TRANS, WIGGLY)
	
<h2>API usage example</h2>
 <p> The following example demonstrates how to use the CIPStereoRecognizer and the equals/equalsTo methods.
 Under the code, you can find the two molecules (m1 and m2).</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 <pre class="sh_java">

//read or build the molecules
Molecule m1, m2;
/* ... */
	
int[] map = { 2, 1, 3, 0 };
Collection&lt;CIPStereoDescriptor&gt; descriptors_m1 = CIPStereoRecognizer.calculateCIPStereoDescriptors(m1);
Collection&lt;CIPStereoDescriptor&gt; descriptors_m2 = CIPStereoRecognizer.calculateCIPStereoDescriptors(m2);
	
CIPStereoDescriptorIface desc1 = (CIPStereoDescriptorIface) descriptorArray_m1.toArray()[0];
CIPStereoDescriptorIface desc2 = (CIPStereoDescriptorIface) descriptorArray_m2.toArray()[0];

System.out.println(desc1.equals(desc2)); 		//false
System.out.println(desc1.equalsTo(desc2, map)); 	//true
 </pre></blockquote>
