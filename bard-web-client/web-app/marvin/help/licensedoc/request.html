<h2>Requesting License</h2>

<h4>New customers</h4>
New customers may want first to evaluate our products, which is possible through
obtaining appropriate license file for evaluation purposes.
The license file for evaluation contains all necessary information for time limited use.
When purchasing ChemAxon software you will get the proper license file according
to your software purchase agreement.

<h4>Maintenance</h4>
A new license file is required to use products requiring new license features.
If the "Support Expiration Date" in your current license is up-to-date, no new
license file is needed when you receive software updates.

<h4>Upgrade old license keys</h4>
If you have already purchased products from ChemAxon, you will be sent a new
license file automatically by our sales department,
which needs to be installed using ChemAxon License Manager.<br>
We support old type license files containing license keys till September 1st 2008.<br>
Beyond September 1st 2008  Marvin 5.0, JChem 5.0 and newer versions  will not accept
old license keys. <br>
If the new license file will not be sent to you by September 1st 2008 for any reason,
please contact our sales department.
