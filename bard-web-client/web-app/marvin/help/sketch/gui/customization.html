<h1>Customizing MarvinSketch GUI</h1>
You can personalize the user interface to better suit your needs or style.<br>
For example, you can reorganize the menu bar, you can create, delete or modify toolbars, and many more.<br>
Any changes you make will become your personal default environment, though you can
restore the default settings any time.

<h2>Basic Changes</h2>
<h4>Moving Toolbars</h4>
To move a toolbar, drag it by its separator bar, which is located at the left edge of
horizontal toolbars or at the top of vertical toolbars.<br>
(Note, that depending on the Look&amp;Feel you currently use, the separator bar
might be harder to notice and drag.)<br>
While dragging the toolbar, you can see a colored border around it, indicating the
place and direction the toolbar will have if you finish dragging. Depending on the current
Look&amp;Feel the colors of the border are different. For example, using JGoodies SkyBluer Look&amp;Feel theme,
light-blue border means that the toolbar will float, while dark-blue shows that the toolbar will be docked.
If you set a toolbar to be floating, you can dock it back by closing it.
<h4>Hide/Show Toolbars</h4>
You can change the visibility of toolbars in the <b>View > Toolbars</b> menu.
<h4>Hide/Show Menu Bar</h4>
To hide the Menubar, choose <b>View > Menubar</b>. To show it, press F11 after clicking on the canvas. 
<h4>Hide/Show Status Bar</h4>
<b>View > Status Bar</b> turns the Status Bar on or off.

<h2>Advanced Changes</h2>

The graphical user interface of MarvinSketch can interactively be personalized using the <b>View > Customize</b> dialog.<br>
Note that the customization related functions usually do not ask for confirmation
before taking action to make the procedure faster.
The original interface can be restored any time by choosing <b>View > Configurations > Reset current configuration</b>.
<h3><a class="anchor" name="menus">Menus</a></h3>
<img src="gui-files/customize1.png"><br><br>
By choosing a menu from the Menus list, the contents of the selected menu will be listed in the Menu Contents.<br>
With selecting a menu entry, its detailed help text will appear in the Details field.
If a black triangle is visible on the right side of a menu entry, it means that this entry is a Submenu.
To list the contents of the submenu, select it from the Menus list.

<h3>Popups</h3>

The customization of Pop-up menus are similar to normal menus. However it is not
possible to remove, rename or create a new Pop-up menu, you can only change the contents of the available Pop-up menus.
The reason for this is that these menus are context-sensitive, and their name and
existence are bound to the underlying contexts.

<h3><a class="anchor" name="shorcuts">Keymap</a></h3>
It is possible to define and switch between Keymap Shemes, where all Sheme is a different shortcut-set.<br>
On the Keymap tab, you can browse all available commands of MarvinSketch to define shortcuts
to any of the commands you would like to.<br>

<img src="gui-files/customize4.png"><br><br>

Only one scheme can be active at a time. A scheme can be made active by selecting and pressing the <b>Activate</b> button.
If a scheme is based on another it means that all of the shortcuts are inherited
from the base scheme, though they can be overwritten one-by-one.
<b>Duplicating</b> a scheme will create and activate a new scheme which will be based upon the previously selected one.
Shemes - except the default one - can also be <b>Removed</b>.<br>

<h4>Adding shortcuts</h4>
A shortcut can be added by focusing the Shortcut field, and pressing the desired shortcut combination, for example F1.
If the shortcut already exists, a warning message appears, and shows which command has the activated shortcut.<br>
<img src="gui-files/customize6.png"><br><br>
The <b>Tab</b> button is required if you would like to use the Tab key for a shortcut,
because if you press Tab in the Shortcut field, it will loose the focus instead of defining the shortcut.<br>
The <b>Clear</b> button helps you to remove the shortcut from the field, because pressing the
Backspace button defines a new shortcut instead of removing it.
<p>
This document described the interactive way of customizing the user interface using the user interface itself.
Another way of personalization is shown in the <a href="configurations.html">Configurations</a> document.</p>
<p>
The same method can be used on <a href="customization_server_side.html">server side</a> as well.</p>
