<TD><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"><PRE><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The start of the project information model is the PROJECT table.  Each Project consists of a set of PROJECT_STEPs.  A step is the link between two EXPERIMENTs.<BR>So experiments form the nodes and steps the edges in a graphical display of the project.  The intent of the graph is to capture the decision making process (knowledge) that was applied during project execution.<BR>Since Projects and Experiments also exist on other external systems, they have an EXTERNAL_REFERENCE which contains informaiton to create a URL to link to this other source.<BR><BR>Both the the Project and the Step have annotations attached to them.  PROJECT_CONTEXT (with PROJECT_CONTEXT_ITEM) and STEP_CONTEXT (with STEP_CONTEXT_ITEM) hold the annotations and group them into annotation sets.  Each annotation is an attribute/value pair based on the same dictionary (ELEMENT) that is used for assay context information.<BR><BR>Generally the Project Context contains annotations about the results and inputs of the project (the probes, the funding, the overall target) and the Step Context contains annotations of the individual decisions in the progress of the project (the activity threshold for compounds coming into the experiment, the number of hits transferred from one experiment to the next, the stage or purpose of the experiment in the project).<BR><BR>Projects can also be defined for different purposes.  For example one set of "projects" has been defined by the overlap of similar compounds between experiments.  In sme senses this mimics the decision making, but is capable of showing overlaps between entirely separate and possibly unrelated organizationally based projects.</FONT></PRE>&nbsp;</FONT></TD>
