Assay
    assayTitle --> assayShortName
    xsd -- assay no longer has direct association to assayContextItems, all assayContextItems under a given assayContext
    xsd - removed assayDocuments element, assay documents will be in links element
AssayContext
    xsd - added attribute assayContextId
    xsd - added new context_group
    xsd - added display_order
    xsd - optional measureRefs with 1 to many measureRef elements
AssayContextItem
    xsd - added displayOrder as attribute 
    xsd - removed attribute assayContextRef
    xsd - added assayContextItemId
Measure
    xsd - attribute assayContextRef eliminated
    xsd - attribute added measureId 
    xsd - renamed entityUnit to entityUnitRef
    xsd - add statsModifierRef to Element
    xsd - attribute parentMeasure renamed to parentMeasureRef, this is optional


Experiment
    xsd - changed experimentName from attribute to element
    xsd - removed experimentContextItems
    xsd - removed project steps 
    xsd - removed externalReferences, will be converted to links with External Reference becoming top level resource
    TODO implement or discuss Experiment measures


Projects
    xsd - Now lists a list of linked Project's just like Assays
        - This is because projects have too many elements now
          and the potential exists that we may have to add
	    paging.
Project
    xsd - removed ProjectContextItem
    xsd - added Project Context
    xsd - added Project Documents
    xsd - added links for external references
    
Project Step
    xsd - addeed experimentRef
    xsd - added proceedingExperimentRef
    xsd - removed links
    xsd - added step Contexts

StepContext
    xsd - ( just like assay context and projext context )
    xsd  - step contexts have stepcontextitem

Dictionary:
Element
    xsd - removed attribute unit, this will know be expressed as a link


TODO//
should add project Document mime type
model External System and External Reference as a resource


Dictionary:
Element change unit from string to fk

Project Info:
add project document ( refactor code for assayDocument )
add / refactor for Step_context and project_context
add / refactor for Step_context_item and project_context_item ( same as assay context except for owning fk and attribute_type )

Results Info
add Experiment Context and ExperimentContextItem
add Project Context and ProjectContextItem
refactor around Rslt_context_item

Potentially deffer or lower priority

add Experiment Context and ExperimentContextItem
refactor around Rslt_context_item

Reasoning NCGC is not pulling, Results yet.

Questions

Project_Step
Experiment_ID is not nullable but cardinality notation indicates Experiment is optional, this is inconsistant.  Should Experiment be optional?
Should Project.projectSteps be a list? or should the projectSteps have some ordering?  Currently what should we order on?


Should replicateNumber be null or >= 0

are there any constraints on valueNum, valueMin, and valueMax and valudeDisplay

Should AssayContextMeasure constraint that Measure.assay and AssayContext.assay be the same Assay
