Assay Overview:

The HDL uptake primary assay is looking for a decrease in fluorescence.  It is possible that a compound will cause cells to decrease HDL uptake due to non-specific consequences of cellular toxicity. Therefore, we would like to make sure that lead compounds are not toxic in the 3 hour time period used in the primary assay.  Cells are treated with compounds for 3 hours and then cell viability is measured using the Cell Titer Glo Assay which is a luciferase-based reagent that measures cellular ATP levels. Compounds will be tested at 8 different doses to determine IC50 values.

Expected Outcome:

Cells that are cytotoxic will decrease cellular ATP levels resulting in a decrease in luminescence.  Compounds that are cytotoxic after 3 hours will be eliminated from consideration.""" ;

_:doc3003 adf:hasContent """PRESENCE OF CONTROLS: Neutral control wells (NC; n=32) and positive control wells (PC; n=32) were included on every plate.

EXPECTED OUTCOME: Active compounds result in  decreasing readout signal.

ACTIVE CONCENTRATION LIMIT:
For each sample, the highest valid tested concentration (Max_Concentration) was determined and the active concentration limit (AC_limit) was set to equal  (10)(Max_Concentration).

NORMALIZATION:
The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Neutral Controls' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3):
The median raw signal of the intraplate  neutral controls (NC) is set to a normalized activity value of 0.
A normalized activity value of 100 is defined as (2)(NC).
A normalized activity value of -50 is defined as (0.5)(NC).
Experimental wells values were scaled to this range.

PATTERN CORRECTION:  The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Runwise Pattern (Multiplicative)' in Genedata (v7.0.3) was applied to the normalized plate data.

MEASUREMENT USED TO DETERMINE ACTIVE CONCENTRATION (AC): AC50
AC values were calculated using the curve fitting strategies in Genedata Screener Condoseo (7.0.3).
AC values were calculated up to the active concentration limit described for each sample.
pAC was set to equal -1*log10(AC)

PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME:
Activity_Outcome = 1 (inactive) when:
a) compound shows activity but in a direction opposite to the expected outcome
in these cases, values describing curve fitting parameters (Sinf, S0, Hill Slope, log_AC50, log_AC50_SE) are set to null
b) curve fit is constant where activity is > -30% and < 30% at all tested concentrations, or
c) AC > AC_limit
Activity_Outcome = 2 (active) when:
AC <= AC_limit
Activity_Outcome = 3 (inconclusive) when:
a) Curve fitting strategy resulted in a constant fit with activity >= -70% but <= -30%, or
b) The fit was deemed not valid due to poor fit quality.

PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE:
If PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 1 (inactive) or 3 (inconclusive),
then PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 0
If PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 2 (active)
then PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = (10)(pAC)
Scores relate to AC in this manner:
120 = 1 pM
90 = 1 nM
60 = 1 uM
30 = 1 mM
0 = 1 M
When the active concentration (AC) is calculated to be greater than the highest valid tested concentration (Max_Concentration), the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is calculated using Max_Concentration as the basis.
When the active concentration (AC) is calculated to be less than the lowest tested concentration, the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is calculated using the lowest tested concentration as the basis.

Note:
The individual dose data point columns ('Activity_at_xxuM') reported here represent the median of valid (unmasked) replicate observations at each concentration. These values are the inputs to a curve fitting algorithm.
All other data columns represent values which are derived during the curve fitting algorithm; this may sometimes include automatic further masking of some replicate data points.
Occasionally this results in perceived inconsistencies: for example, between the derived 'Maximal_Activity' and the apparent most active data point.""" ;
